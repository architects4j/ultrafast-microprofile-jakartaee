**Presentation**: Ultra-fast MicroProfile e Jakarta EE with Microstream presentation

**Description**: Within the world of Java standards, Eclipse MicroProfile and Jakarta EE bring several facilities and functionalities to make the development of microservices in the cloud-native era something straightforward. And this platform will be even better with a database engine that promises to be 1000 times faster than the relational database. Meet the Microstream: a fundamentally new persistence framework for storing complex Java object graphs natively, which means the object graph is stored on disk as it is in RAM.
